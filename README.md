NOMCOM Selection on the Web
===========================

The randomized selection process defined in [RFC 3797](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3797.html)
helps ensure the integrity of the IETF NOMCOM process.  In order to verify that
the NOMCOM chair has run the algorithm properly, other people in the community
need to re-run the algorithm to verify that they get the same results.  In order
to make this easy, this repository has a simple web page that runs the
selection algorithm.
